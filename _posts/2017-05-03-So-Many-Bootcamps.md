title: Overwhelmed with Options.
---

Once you decide to enter a bootcamp there is an equally difficult question that follows.  Where and How? 

There are so many options, and it pays to do your research.
Many boot camps require you to give 100% of your time to them for several weeks.  Most of the boot camps that follow this trajectory cost upwards of $20,000.   I had a friend who went through
one of these programs, and she ended up with a great job in the industry.  However, in order to do so she had to give them 100% of their time.  For many people that might not be a problem.

If you are anything like me, devoting yourself 100% to a program was impossible.  I have bills to pay, and can't afford to loose health insurance for my family.  Leaving my current position before I have something else in place was not possible, so I started to seek out other options.  I found a few programs that would allow for part-time courses locally in my area, but none of them provided the flexibility in their scheduling I need.  They were " Monday - Thursday from 5-9 for 6 months" and schedules of that nature, that were fixed with no flexibility.  Soon after I found Bloc, and a few other online programs that offered an entirely flexible schedule.

I settled on Bloc for a variety of reasons.  What drew my attention at first was the cost.  The cost was very reasonable, and it was the catalyst for my continued research in the program.
Once I found the tuition rate , I was intrigued enough to do more research and found Bloc to be one of the longest standing online Boot camps.  I was also intrigued by the flipped classroom
concept they used involving mentors.  Being able to learn from people who have years of the experience in the industry has been invaluable.  They also provide a guarantee that you'll find a job within a few months of graduating or your money back.  I figured, what do I have to loose, and enrolled.

Whether Bloc is right for you, depends on your personal goals.  Research and figure out what it is you want to do, and find the right program for you that will give you a foundation of the skills you need to make that a reality.  Make sure you can make the time commitment for whatever program you choose.
