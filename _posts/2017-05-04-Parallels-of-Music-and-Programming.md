title: Parallels of Music and Programming
---

When someone talks about a musician the word that first comes to mind for most is _creativity_.

 This is what has drawn me to music and the arts in general for most of my life.  In reality, creativity is only part of the picture.  

 There is an analytical side to music that is just as important.  In order to perform a piece of music with advanced musicianship and
musicality, requires just as much analysis and critical thinking as it does creativity.  As such, so do the intricacies of playing an instrument at a high level.
During my studies to learn web development, I didn't expect to see many similarities between the two fields.  I expected to be learning a skill.  Much to my surprise, I've been able to explore my creativity in ways that use the same part of my brain ( or at least it seems so, I'm certainly no scientist ).  Starting with nothing and creating something with code requires creativity.  Of course, it also requires deep
analysis, critical thinking, and knowledge of the tools being used to make that creation.  Not so unlike the musician and their instrument.

Perhaps they aren't so different after all.
